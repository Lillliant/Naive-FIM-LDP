C, C++, Java, Python; Self-implementation (accuracy, time)

- ACM/IEEE → Highlight contribution to course
- Zip file of implementation & Text / Word file of explanation
- Algorithm against 3 parameters (Select 5 frequent pattern/itemset mining algorithms. Implement in C++, C, Java, or Python, whichever you are comfortable with. Analyze the dataset and your experimentation of the algorithms on the provided datasets. Measure the performance of the algorithms and provide suggestions)
    - Accuracy: 0-1
        - report value based on dataset for dataset
